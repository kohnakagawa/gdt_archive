# My Ghidra data type archive repository

For formatting the decompiled results of Ghidra, it is important to properly edit the types of variables. Ghidra provides the type definitions for some platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS by default (as gdt files), but sometimes that is not enough.

This repository contains the gdt files that I used for my reverse engineering.

## How are these gdt files created?

I used [gdt_helper](https://github.com/kohnakagawa/gdt_helper) to make these gdt files.

Feel free to pull-request for a new gdt file.
